[Webhook](https://github.com/luigisainini/webhook/) Dockerized
=================

## Running webhook in Docker
The simplest usage of [lousab/webhook](https://hub.docker.com/r/lousab/webhook/) image is for one to host the hooks JSON file on their machine and mount the directory in which those are kept as a volume to the Docker container:
```shell
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /dir/to/hooks/on/host:/etc/webhook --name=webhook \
  lousab/webhook -verbose -hooks=/etc/webhook/hooks.json -hotreload
```

Another method of using this Docker image is to create a simple `Dockerfile`:
```docker
FROM lousab/webhook
COPY hooks.json.example /etc/webhook/hooks.json
```

This `Dockerfile` and `hooks.json.example` files should be placed inside the same directory. After that run `docker build -t my-webhook-image .` and then start your container:
```shell
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=webhook my-webhook-image -verbose -hooks=/etc/webhook/hooks.json -hotreload
```

Additionally, one can specify the parameters to be passed to [webhook](https://github.com/luigisainini/webhook/) in `Dockerfile` simply by adding one more line to the previous example:
```docker
FROM lousab/webhook
COPY hooks.json.example /etc/webhook/hooks.json
CMD ["-verbose", "-hooks=/etc/webhook/hooks.json", "-hotreload"]
```

Now, after building your Docker image with `docker build -t my-webhook-image .`, you can start your container by running just:
```shell
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=webhook my-webhook-image
```
